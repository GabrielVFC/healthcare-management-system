# Hospital Management System (SQL & Database Design) 🏥

A comprehensive database solution designed for a healthcare environment. This project demonstrates advanced skills in **Relational Database Design**, implementing robust schemas with SQLite to manage patients, medical staff, appointments, and diagnostic exams.

### 🚀 Key Technical Features

* **Comprehensive Schema Design (DDL)**: Implemented structured tables using Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and Autoincrement constraints to ensure data integrity.
* **Advanced Data Querying (DQL)**: Developed complex queries using multiple `JOIN` operations (Inner, Left) to connect patient records with medical history.
* **Analytical Insights**: Integrated aggregate functions (`AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN/MAX`) and date manipulation using `JULIANDAY()` to calculate metrics like average patient age.
* **Business Logic**: Created advanced filtering using `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, and `GROUP BY/HAVING` clauses to extract actionable medical data.

### 🛠 SQL Mastery Demonstrated

- **Relational Integrity**: Managing one-to-many and many-to-many relationships through specialized join tables.
- **Set Operations**: Utilizing `UNION` to consolidate data from different entities into unified reports.
- **Optimized Persistence**: Implementation of flexible data types and efficient indexing for a SQLite environment.

### 💻 Tech Stack
- **Database Engine:** SQLite
- **Languages:** SQL (DDL, DML, DQL)
- **Concepts:** Relational Algebra, Database Normalization, Aggregate Analysis.

*Note: This project showcases my ability to architect and manage relational data. I am currently scaling these SQL foundations into Go (Golang) back-end services with PostgreSQL and Docker.*
